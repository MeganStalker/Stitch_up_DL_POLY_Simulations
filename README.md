# stitch up

This script:

1.	Concatenates the output files (OUTPUT, SOLVAT, HISTORY) generated by performing a DL POLY simulation and restarted using the restart.sh script
2. 	Visualises an observable (the timesteps from the HISTORY file) to assist the user in determining whether the files are corrupt

## Notes:

* Throughout this script, operations on HISTORY files are commented out as these operations are time and resource intensive. 
* Please uncomment the relevant lines (91, 119, 125) to execute operations on HISTORY files 

* Line 91:

```
# cat HISTORY_$num >> ../HISTORY_tmp
```

* Line 119:

```
# mv $fold/HISTORY_tmp .
```

* Line 125:

```
# cat save$numdir/HISTORY_$num >> HISTORY_tmp
```

# If you cannot access screen resources to plot a graph using Gnuplot, please replace line 149 

``` gnuplot --persist -e 'plot "timesteps"; pause mouse close; exit gnuplot'
```

# with line 153
```
gnuplot --persist -e 'set terminal 'dumb'; plot "timesteps"; pause mouse close; exit gnuplot'
```
